I never thought I had known such a real sense of failure until today, when a system diagnostic became intent on showing me just how hard of a failure we will be experiencing together.

The system failed so hard, I was actually sent home from work for the day, and the system called my mom on the phone to inform her just how much of a failure this was. They scheduled a Parent-System conference for next week.
