Second video in the python for maya series, just released through [cmiVFX](http://www.cmivfx.com)!

### [Python For Maya &#8211; Volume 2](https://cmivfx.com/store/328-python-for-maya-vol-02)

_If you watched the first video, you now have a good grasp on Python. Sweet. Let&#8217;s plow through some more involved concepts like python juggernauts!_

> With a working knowledge of the python scripting language, and the Maya Python commands API, we can continue to learn new ways to solve more challenging problems, create complete scripts, and build user interfaces around our tools. We also introduce the Maya Python API; a lower-level interface into Maya.
> 
> This video focuses more on breaking down full scripts, as opposed to typing out syntax. Its jam packaged with information and moves fast to deliver you as much brain food as possible. The first segment of the video transitions from beginning to intermediate level, with the majority of the video being intermediate, and finishing out by touching on advanced concepts. The included project files are abundant, complete, and full of helpful documentation so that you can take your time and learn about each piece of the tools.

If you check it out, leave me feedback!
