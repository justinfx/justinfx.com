On my last day of work at South Park Studios, my co-worker Tory gave me a present. It&#8217;s a book that collects together a history of doodles and graphics, capturing significant moments during my 4 year run with the team.

Tory tends to represent our team as dog characters. I can be identified usually by the pierced chin. Much of this content refers to inside jokes, but I feel it also has a number of generally hilarious imagery.

Thank you, Tory!
