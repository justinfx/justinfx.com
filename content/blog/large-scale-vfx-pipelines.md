excerpt = "The render farm is one of the most important, high traffic components of a modern VFX pipeline. Beyond the hardware itself a render farm requires careful management and maintenance to ensure it is operating at peak efficiency. In WETAs case this hardware consists of a mix of over 80,000 CPU cores and a number of GPU resources, and as this has grown it has introduced many interesting scalability challenges."

At the SIGGRAPH 2017 Convention, in Los Angeles, I had represented Weta Digital and presented a 20 minute talk under the Pipe Dreams category:

[SIGGRAPH 2017 > Talks > Pipe Dreams](http://s2017.siggraph.org/talks/sessions/pipe-dreams.html)

The talk was entitled [Large Scale VFX Pipelines](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3085021) and focused on Weta's migration from an older commercial render farm solution, to an in-house render farm called Plow. It detailed the problems, the challenged in switching, the methods used to make a successful migration, and the results of the change.

> To ensure peak utilization of hardware resources and handle the increasingly dynamic demands placed on its render farm infrastructure, Weta Digital developed custom queuing, scheduling, job description, and submission systems. This talk presents the scalability issues encountered and details the strategy, process, and results in solving these problems.

A video of the presentation is available here: [Video Stream](https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3085021&type=mp4&path=%2F3090000%2F3085021%2Ftalks-0002%2Emp4)
